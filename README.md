# Train Table
A table of train information which utilizes Firebase for the database. All train information is user-submitted. The next arrival and minutes away columns of the table are calculated based on the frequency and first train arrival time.

In addition to Firebase, this app also utilizes jQuery for the logic, and Bootstrap 4 for the layout.

Test out the app here: https://slizbethellis.github.io/train-table/

P.S. There is a location based Easter egg. See if you can enter a location that'll make the secret text appear in the footer.
